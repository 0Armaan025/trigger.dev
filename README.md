# About Trigger.dev

Create long-running jobs directly within your codebase with features like API integrations, webhooks, scheduling, and delays.

## Long-Running Jobs on Serverless

Reliably run jobs without worrying about function timeouts; we handle those for you.

- Auto-resume after a function timeout.
- Auto-resume after a server outage.
- Add delays of up to a year.

## In Your Codebase

Create jobs where they belong: in your codebase. Version control, localhost, test, review, and deploy just as you're used to.

## Secure by Design

We only receive triggers and the data you choose to send to us. You can even completely self-host the entire platform.

## No Worries About Deployment

Simply use our SDK to write jobs in your codebase. There's nothing extra to deploy, and no CI configuration required; your jobs seamlessly connect to our cloud. Alternatively, you can self-host.

## Full Visibility of Every Job Run

View every task in every run, so you can precisely understand what happened.

## Built-in Integrations

Easily integrate with hundreds of third-party APIs, including your own. Use API keys (which never leave your server) or let us handle OAuth for you. Install our integration packages and easily subscribe to webhooks and perform common tasks. You can also utilize your favorite existing Node.JS SDKs for resumability and idempotency through our `runTask` function.

## Our Progress

We're building the most comprehensive and user-friendly background jobs framework for developers.

# Getting Started

Visit our documentation [here](https://trigger.dev/docs).

## Self-Host

We provide an official Trigger.dev Docker image that you can use to easily self-host the platform. We're working on more extensive guides, but we currently offer a [Fly.io example repository](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/fly.io) with instructions in the README for deploying and using a self-hosted instance of Trigger.dev on Fly.io.

## Development

To set up and develop locally or contribute to the open-source project, follow our [development guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

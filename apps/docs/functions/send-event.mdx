## How to send an event

You can send an event from anywhere in your code, including from inside another workflow.

```ts
import { sendEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

//send an event with the name "user.created"
//and the payload
await sendEvent("start-fire-2", {
  name: "user.created",
  payload: { userId: "123456" },
});
```

If you are calling this from inside a workflow, ensure that the first parameter is unique inside your workflow.

## Sending events from other workflows

It is useful to send events from workflows because you can split your logic into smaller chunks and reuse them.

## Writing a workflow that is triggered by an event

You should read [the documentation on custom events](/triggers/custom-events) to learn how to write a workflow that is triggered by an event.

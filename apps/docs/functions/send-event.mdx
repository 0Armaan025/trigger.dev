## Send an event

You can easily send an event from anywhere, including from inside another workflow. Events don't have to come from the same server as your workflow and can be sent as HTTP requests from any language (see our cURL example below for the format).

```ts
import { sendEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

//send an event with the name "user.created"
//and the payload
await sendEvent("start-fire-2", {
  name: "user.created",
  payload: { userId: "123456" },
});
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="cURL">

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://app.trigger.dev/api/v1/events \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <insert_api_key_here>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
            "id": "<insert_unique_event_id>",
            "event": {
              "name": "user.created",
              "payload": {
                      "userId": "123456"
              }
            }
          }'
```

If you are calling this from inside a workflow, ensure that the first parameter is unique inside your workflow.

## Sending events from other workflows

It is useful to send events from workflows because you can split your logic into smaller chunks and reuse them.

## Writing a workflow that is triggered by an event

You should read [the documentation on custom events](/triggers/custom-events) to learn how to write a workflow that is triggered by an event.

## Examples

### Every 5 minutes

This job will run every 5 minutes, starting 5 minutes after this code is first run on your server (that includes running locally).

```ts
import { Trigger, scheduleEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

new Trigger({
  id: "scheduled-workflow",
  name: "Scheduled Workflow",
  apiKey: "<your_api_key>",
  on: scheduleEvent({ rateOf: { minutes: 5 } }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    await ctx.logger.info("Received the scheduled event", {
      event,
      wallTime: new Date(),
    });

    return { foo: "bar" };
  },
}).listen();
```

### Using CRON syntax

This job will run at 2:30pm every Monday. You can get help with [CRON syntax](https://crontab.guru/).

```ts
import { Trigger, scheduleEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

new Trigger({
  id: "cron-scheduled-workflow",
  name: "Cron Scheduled Workflow",
  apiKey: "<your_api_key>",
  on: scheduleEvent({ cron: "30 14 * * 1" }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    await ctx.logger.info("Received the cron scheduled event", {
      event,
      wallTime: new Date(),
    });

    return { foo: "bar" };
  },
}).listen();
```

## Preventing late runs

To prevent a scheduled trigger from running late, you can set a `triggerTTL` option when creating the `Trigger`, like so:

```ts
new Trigger({
  id: "scheduled-workflow",
  name: "Scheduled Workflow",
  apiKey: "<your_api_key>",
  on: scheduleEvent({ rateOf: { minutes: 5 } }),
  triggerTTL: 300,
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    await ctx.logger.info("Received the scheduled event", {
      event,
      wallTime: new Date(),
    });

    return { foo: "bar" };
  },
}).listen();
```

This will prevent the trigger from running if it is running more than `300` seconds behind, which can happen if the server running your `Trigger` code goes down or is otherwise unavailable.

This is especially useful for scheduled triggers that run on a very short interval, like every minute, so you don't get a backlog of runs that all run at once when the server comes back online.

<Tip>
  Set your `triggerTTL` to the same time (or double) as the rateOf the trigger.

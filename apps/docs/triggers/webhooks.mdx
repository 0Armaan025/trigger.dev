If you want your server to be notified when one of your users has subscribed to your product, or someone has made a change to a support ticket, then you should use webhooks.

## Advantages of using Trigger.dev for webhooks

Webhooks can be difficult to work with, especially when developing locally. We make them far easier to use with our [integrations](/integrations/apis).

- You don't need to register/unregister for webhooks, we do it for you
- They work locally during development without needing to use tunnels (e.g. Ngrok)
- We receive the webhook, then keep trying to send it to you until you receive it. If your server goes down, no problem.

## Send a Slack message when a GitHub issue is labeled as Critical

```ts
import { Trigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { github, slack } from "@trigger.dev/integrations";

new Trigger({
  id: "escalate-critical-issues",
  name: "Posts to Slack when GitHub Issue created or modified",
  apiKey: "<my_api_key>",
  //this is the webhook subscription
  on: github.events.issueEvent({
    repo: "my-github-org/my-github-repo",
  }),
  //this function is run when the webhook fires
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    if (event.action === "labeled") {
      await ctx.logger.info(
        `The issue ${event.issue.title} was labeled ${event.label.name}`
      );

      if (event.label.name === "critical") {
        await slack.postMessage("send-to-slack", {
          channel: "serious-issues",
          text: `Critical issue: ${event.issue.title} was labeled ${event.label.name}`,
        });
      }
    }

    return event;
  },
}).listen();
```

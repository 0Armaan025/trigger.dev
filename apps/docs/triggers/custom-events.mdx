[Send an event](/functions/send-event) and any workflows that subscribe to that Custom event will get triggered.

## Name and Schemas

### Name

Custom event triggers have a `name`. They will only get triggered when a custom even with that name are sent.

### Schema

Custom event triggers have a schema. This is used to validate the data that is sent with the event. If the data does not match the schema, the workflow will not run.

## Example

```ts
import { Trigger, customEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { slack } from "@trigger.dev/integrations";

//this workflow will run when a "user.created" event is sent
new Trigger({
  id: "new-user-slack",
  name: "New user slack message",
  apiKey: "<your_api_key>",
  //this is the custom event subscription
  on: customEvent({
    name: "user.created",
    schema: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      email: z.string(),
      paidPlan: z.boolean(),
    }),
  }),
  //this function is run when the custom event is received
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    //send a message to the #new-users Slack channel with user details
    const response = await slack.postMessage("send-to-slack", {
      channel: "new-users",
      text: `New user: ${event.name} (${event.email}) signed up. ${
        event.paidPlan ? "They are paying" : "They are on the free plan"
      }.`,
    });

    return response.message;
  },
}).listen();
```

That workflow will never run, unless an event is sent from your code somewhere â€“ it can be sent from a completely different server.

## Sending an event

There is a [full guide on sending events](/functions/send-event) but here is a quick example:

```ts
import { sendEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

//send an event with the name "user.created"
await sendEvent({
  name: "user.created",
  data: {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@doe.com",
    paidPlan: true,
  },
});
```

<Note>
  The same event can trigger many different workflows, it's not one-to-one.

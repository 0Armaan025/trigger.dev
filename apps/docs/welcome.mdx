Trigger.dev is an open source platform that enables developers to create event-driven background tasks directly in their code. Build, test and run workflows locally and subscribe to webhooks, schedule jobs, run background jobs and add long delays easily and reliably.

Workflows live in your codebase so you can use your existing types, functions, version control and IDE. They are triggered by us but run on your server so your private data is never exposed.

Go to [trigger.dev](https://app.trigger.dev) and sign up or login to your account.

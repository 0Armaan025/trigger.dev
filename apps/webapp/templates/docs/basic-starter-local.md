## Run locally

First, clone the repo and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/triggerdotdev/basic-starter.git
cd basic-starter
npm install
```

Then create a `.env` file with your development Trigger.dev API Key:

```sh
echo "TRIGGER_API_KEY=<APIKEY>" >> .env
```

And finally you are ready to run the process:

```sh
npm run dev
```

You should see a message like the following:

```
[trigger.dev]  âœ¨ Connected and listening for events [basic-starter]
```

## Developing

The development branch is `main`. This is the branch that all pull
requests should be made against. The changes on the `main`
branch are tagged into a release monthly.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version >=16.x
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) version 12 or greater
- [pnpm package manager](https://pnpm.io/installation) version 7
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

### Setup

1. Clone the repo into a public GitHub repository or [fork the repo](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/fork). If you plan to distribute the code, keep the source code public to comply with the [Apache Licence 2.0](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/blob/main/LICENSE).

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev.git
      ```
      > If you are on windows, run the following command on gitbash with admin privileges:
      > `git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://triggerdotdev/trigger.dev.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder
      ```
      cd trigger.dev
      ```
3. Install the required packages using pnpm.
      ```

      ```
4. Create your `.env` files
      ```
      cp .env.example .env && cp packages/database/.env.example packages/database/.env
      ```
      Open the root `.env` file and fill in the required values.
6. Start Docker. This starts the required services like Postgres.
      ```
      pnpm run docker
      ```
7. Migrate the database
      ```
      pnpm run db:migrate
      ```
8. Run the seed script
      ```
      pnpm run db:seed
      ```
5. Run the project. See the section below.

## Running

You can run the project with:
      ```
      pnpm run dev --filter webapp
      ```
      
It should run on `port:3030`
